The Context API in React is a built-in feature that allows you to share data (or "state") across multiple components without having to pass props down manually through every level of the component tree. It's part of React since version 16.3.

Why Use the Context API?
Avoid Prop Drilling:

In traditional React apps, data is passed from parent to child components through props. This can become cumbersome and repetitive, especially in deep component hierarchies.
Context API eliminates the need to pass props manually through every intermediate component.
